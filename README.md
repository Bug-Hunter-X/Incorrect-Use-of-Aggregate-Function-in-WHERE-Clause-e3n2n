This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries: using an aggregate function like AVG() within the WHERE clause.  The provided SQL query attempts to find employees in the Sales department whose salary is greater than the average salary. However, using AVG(salary) directly in the WHERE clause is syntactically incorrect in most SQL dialects. The solution demonstrates the correct approach, using a subquery to calculate the average salary separately and then using that value in the WHERE clause.
